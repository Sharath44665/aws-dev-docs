## What is Amazon EKS?
Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) is a managed service that **eliminates the need to install, operate, and maintain your own Kubernetes control plane on Amazon Web Services (AWS).** Kubernetes is an `open-source system that automates the management, scaling, and deployment of containerized applications`.

## Features of Amazon EKS

The following are key features of Amazon EKS:

### Secure networking and authentication
> Amazon EKS integrates your Kubernetes workloads with AWS networking and security services. It also integrates with `AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)` to provide authentication for your Kubernetes clusters.
### Easy cluster scaling
> Amazon EKS enables you to scale your Kubernetes clusters up and down easily based `on the demand` of your workloads. Amazon EKS supports horizontal Pod autoscaling based on CPU or custom metrics, and cluster autoscaling based on the demand of the entire workload.

### Managed Kubernetes experience
> You can make changes to your Kubernetes clusters using **eksctl**, AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), the API, kubectl, and Terraform

### High availability
> Amazon EKS provides high availability for your control plane across multiple Availability Zones.
### Integration with AWS services
> Amazon EKS integrates with other AWS services, providing a comprehensive platform for `deploying and managing your containerized applications`. You can also more easily **troubleshoot your Kubernetes workloads with various observability tools**.
